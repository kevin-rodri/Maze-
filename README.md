# Maze Game

## Features
This program is a maze game I wrote in Python in high school. It is a fun project and a fantastic game if you want to do something during your downtime. 

## How to run
Clone this project, open in your IDE of choice (I recommend running this on Visual Studio Code, but I wrote this program on a web IDE like trinket.io and repl.it), press the run button, and have fun! To move the Turtle forward, press k. To move the Turtle to the right, press l. To move the Turtle to the left, press j. To move the Turtle upwards, press i. To move the Turtle downwards, press m. 

**Note**: Please ensure your machine at least has Python 3 installed before doing the steps above. 

## About the code
I designed a maze program, followed by reading an article assigned through the Project Lead The Way (PLTW) server, a non-profit organization that teaches STEM to middle and high-school students. This program aims for the **Turtle** to find a way to get out of the maze. 

**Credits**: Project Lead The Way for coming up with the idea for this project and Mr.Hassan Bourhrous, my high school programming instructor, for the feedback provided for this project.
